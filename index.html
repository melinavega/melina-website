        <p class="lead mb-4">Melina Vega is a first year English major and first generation Mexican American woman. Vega has always been surrounded by hard working individuals. Her parents divorced when she was 11 years old and since then she has been a witness to her single
          motherâ€™s ambition. Her mother encouraged her and motivated her to keep fighting and prove the world wrong. Melina is now attending the University of California, Riverside and majoring in Literature. Writing has been her main passion and she
          constantly loves to keep the pages flowing. She first began writing short stories at the age of 12, but her first encounter with actual novels was in third grade. The series of Percy Jackson was the first to introduce her to her eternal passion.
          A passion that would eventually lead her to success. She is always determined to improve her education. She will eventually go to the teaching field. Her goal is to teach high schoolers about the world of books. As a child with limitations,
          dreams are what expand their future.<br><br> Melinaâ€™s first venture into a career began in high school. She worked at school in a company known as Jdub Hub. It consisted of new broadcasting for their entire school. Melina played a major role
          in the company when she joined in the year of 2019. She began as a middle manager that would ensure her group recorded and posted videos. She would create topics and contracts between her group and an activity. She would use time after school
          to film. This job opened her up to the usage of complex programs, such as imovie, garageband and many more. Throughout the year her boss realized that she was very charismatic and needed to be seen more than just the behind the scenes. She became
          the official weekly anchor for their show. Before they knew it she became the face for their company. Students all over the school recognized her and would constantly ask about how it was to work for the school.<br><br> Followed quickly after
          her experience at a broadcasting company she moved onto work in a completely different field. She was reached out to by a friend who recommended her to work at an ice cream shop. The store was an extremely famous chain, it was none other than
          La Michoacana. Nervous to go to the interview, she was hired on the spot. Melina began working there and completely caught onto all the recipes. She works well under fast paced environments, and constantly pushes to perform the best. She was
          extremely reliable and the boss constantly called her when they had to turn on to somebody. Her jobs are from a variety of fields. Melina is versatile and is constantly willing to work in any environment. She always performs well and consistently
          proves to the world what her mom wanted, that she was the best of the best. If there is anyone that should be employed by your company, it is Melina Vega. She is guaranteed to perform the best.
